Answer to the second Question : 
As I have not deployed this software on any server so it can't be called anything
But If we used this programming paradigm we would get a centralized system because the main database stored only on server would be a singular point of modification and failure.

If the server node fails and there is no backup, you lose the data straight away.
There is only one server node and due to availability reasons, it is inefficient and unprofessional to take the server down for maintenance.
